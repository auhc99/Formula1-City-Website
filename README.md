# Formula1 City Website
Website for the Formula1 City Theme Park, as part of University of London's Web Development Module.   
I am adding / added more functionality and features to the static website that was done by my team members earlier.  

## My developments:  
- Added responsive Navigation Menu to the website (created navbar.css so that team members can look and see)  
- Animated photos to be flipcards for a primer of the content
